MailWatch Debian patch for JpGraph
---------------------------

If you use standard Debian PHP packages, you need to patch JpGraph to ovoid a bug (missing imageantialias() function)
as php5-gd is not using gd bundled with php5.

If you update JpGraph, update the file src/jpg-config.inc.php with this:

define('ANTIALIASING', false);

Place it a the end of file before the last "?>".
