PER DOMAIN/PER USER FILTERING
-----------------------------

MailWatch for MailScanner 1.0 has new filtering capabilities to be able to
support per-domain filtering or per-user filtering more effectively than
previously.

To utilise this new functionality - all you need to do is create MailWatch 
users named by either their domain or their e-mail address and set their
user type accordingly.

For example:

If you create a user named 'smf@f2s.com' as user type 'User' and I log-in as
that user, I will only be able to see e-mail address to/from me and to be able 
to add Blacklist/Whitelist entries for my address (if enabled).

If I create a user named 'f2s.com' as type 'Domain Administrator' and I log-in
as that user, I will only be able to see messages to/from my domain or create
blacklist/whitelist entries for the entire domain or for a specific user.

The 'Administrator' type can do anything for any user or domain.

If you need to have 'aliases' for your users - e.g. 'smf@f2s.com' also has 
an e-mail alias 'steve.freegard@lbsltd.co.uk', then no problem - use the 
'Filters' screen to add 'steve.freegard@lbsltd.co.uk' and the 'smf@f2s.com'
user will be able to see both.

Easy!

NOTE - the functionality below still exists, however it is now deprecated in 
favour of the per domain/user functionality above.

PER-USER FILTERING - HOWTO
--------------------------

MailWatch for MailScanner 0.5 has introduced the preliminary support for per-user filters - this allows an administrator to create MailWatch users than can either see everything, limit views to certain domains, certain e-mail addresses or to a particular regular expression.

HOW IT WORKS

In 0.5 - you have to set everything up manually using SQL, in later versions of MailWatch, you will be able to create users using the Web Interface.

The 'users' table now contains an extra column named 'type' - this can have one of four values:

'A' - Administrator (can view everything, any filters are ignored)
'D' - Domain Admin (can view domains)
'U' - User (can view specific addresses)
'R' - Regexp (can view items matching regexp)

Next there is a new table called 'user_filters', this has four columns:

username   - this should match the user from the 'users' table.
filter     - this is the text of the filter e.g. 'smf@f2s.com' or 'domain.com'.
verify_key - this is for future use, it should be set to md5(rand()).
active     - this can be set to 'Y' or 'N', if 'N' the rule is ignored.

You can create as many rules per user as you like, they will be OR'd together and AND'd for each from_address and to_address for a match.

EXAMPLES

To create an administrator:
 
INSERT INTO users VALUES ('<username>',md5('<password>'),'<fullname>','A');

To create a domain admin for the domains 'fsl.com' and 'f2s.com':

INSERT INTO users VALUES ('<username>',md5('<password>'),'<fullname>','D');
INSERT INTO user_filters VALUES ('<username>','fsl.com',md5(rand()),'Y');
INSERT INTO user_filters VALUES ('<username>','f2s.com',md5(rand()),'Y');

To create a user that can view the addresses 'foo@bar.com' and 'foo@bar.co.uk':

INSERT INTO users VALUES ('<username>',md5('<password>'),'<fullname>','U');
INSERT INTO user_filters VALUES ('<username>','foo@bar.com',md5(rand()),'Y');
INSERT INTO user_filters VALUES ('<username>','foo@bar.co.uk',md5(rand()),'Y');

To create a view against a regular expression:

INSERT INTO users VALUES ('<username>',md5('<password>'),'<fullname>','R');
INSERT INTO user_filters VALUES ('<username>','<regexp>',md5(rand()),'Y');

Please send any errors, omissions or recipies to the mailing-list or to me.

Thanks!
